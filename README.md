# BOT-TO-SCRAPE-LOL
scrapping bot, dont abuse, get one card and go.

This bot is made to check stock, add to cart, then notify through text. IT CANNOT BUY THE PRODUCT. The notifacation comes within 2 seconds so buy it asap! 

Sign up for twilio on their website and get the trial number. 

When using this make sure you change btn-wide in both areas to btn-wide if you are doing single product scrape or a btn-mini for a link that has a list. This bot will only get the first available item so make sure you give it only items you want in that list.  

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. You will need twilio, scrapy, selnium, and pip installed. 

2. You may need to install requirments, do pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

3. Set up your newegg. 1. Login and save login, save card on your account, and save your address saved. Find your firefox profile, should be in users, will be different for windows/linux.

4. Go through the code and put information where it needs to be put. Ex. Password, Usernames, phone numbers. 

5. Finally go to terminal and type scrapy startproject examplename example_directory.

6. Put this python script in the 'spiders' directory.

8. And Bam good luck!

9. Don't abuse, get one card for yourself and get rid of this bot.

10. I am not responsible for what you do with this bot. This bot was my creation to buy a 3080.
