# BOT-TO-SCRAPE-LOL
scrapping bot, dont abuse, get one card and go.

This bot is made to check stock, add to cart, then notify through text. IT CANNOT BUY THE PRODUCT. The notifacation comes within 2 seconds so buy it asap! 

Sign up for twilio on their website and get the trial number. 

When using this make sure you change btn-wide in both areas to btn-wide if you are doing single product scrape or a btn-mini for a link that has a list. This bot will only get the first available item so make sure you give it only items you want in that list.  

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. You will need twilio, scrapy, selnium, and pip installed.
